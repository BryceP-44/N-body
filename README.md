# Silverbox
N-body simulation with gravity, collisions, conservation of momentum, and optional friction on collisions. Additional physics can be added later.
The turtle library is used for graphics. The next version will be vectorized and probably use blender for 3D visualization. Additionally, turn off collisions if multiple small masses are being used because the time step size is too big. The smaller the time step is, the more accurate it will be, but calculations and movements will take longer. 

This can also be used in higher dimensions for a type of simple artificial intelligence that can be trained.
